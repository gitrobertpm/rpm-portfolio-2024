# Web Dev Portfolio â€” 2024

**Priorities: responsive, mobile-first, modular, accessible, maintainable, scalable, and custom**

Reusable Vue components, custom utility classes, and nested Sass and BEM selectors make this project modular, scalable and a breeze to maintain, update, and customize.

The design is original, unique and perhaps even a bit unconventional overall, but still adheres to the fundamental principles and conventions of modern web development, typography, and accessibility.
